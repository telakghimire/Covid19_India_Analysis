# Covid19_India_Analysis


**Objective**

- To understand the behavior of Covid19 cases and its effects across India.
- Extracting data from the website and performing Data Preparation and Cleaning for further analysis.
- To Analyze the weekly and monthly evolution of the number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, tests, and vaccination across India and also analyze the severity of cases in different states of India.

**Technology Stack**
- Python used for data extraction and data cleaning.
- SQL used for analysis .
- MS-Excel used for visualization and dashboard.

**Dataset Description**

The data was exctracted from the website (https://data.covid19india.org/) containing two json files namely data.min.json and timeseries.min.json.

***Click on the below link to know more about the struture of the data***
- data.min.json: (https://data.covid19india.org/documentation/v4_data.html)
- timeseries.min.json: (https://data.covid19india.org/documentation/timeseries.min.html)

***From the above json files we have created six dataframes or tables for our anlysis by extracting the data from the json file-***
- StateWise_Data containing the attributes - State, Population, Confirmed, Deceased, Tested, Vaccination1, Vaccinated2.
- DistrictWise_Data containing the attributes - State, Disticts, Population, Confirmed, Deceased, Tested, Vaccination1, Vaccinated2. Here the data was in cummulative sum, where we needed to segregate it.
- TimeSeries_Data containing the attributes - State, Date, Confirmed, Deceased, Tested, Vaccination1, Vaccinated2.
- delta7_StateWise_Data - State, delta7_Confirmed, delta7_Deceased, delta7_Tested, delta7_Vaccination1, delta7_Vaccinated2.
- delta7_DistictWise_Data - State, Disticts, Population, delta7_Confirmed, delta7_Deceased, delta7_Tested, delta7_Vaccination1, delta7_Vaccinated2.
- delta7_Timeseries_Data - State, Date, delta7_Confirmed, delta7_Deceased, delta7_Tested, delta7_Vaccination1, delta7_Vaccinated2.

**Problem Statement**

     - Weekly evolution of number of confirmed cases, recovered cases, deaths, tests. For instance, the dashboard should be able to compare Week 3 of May with Week 2 of August.
     - Let’s call `testing ratio(tr) = (number of tests done) / (population)`, now categorise every district in one of the following categories:
          Category A: 0.05 ≤ tr ≤ 0.1
          Category B: 0.1 < tr ≤ 0.3
          Category C: 0.3 < tr ≤ 0.5
          Category D: 0.5 < tr ≤ 0.75
          Category E: 0.75 < tr ≤ 1.0
       Now perform an analysis of number of deaths across all category. Example, what was the number / % of deaths in Category A district as compared for Category E districts.
     - Compare delta7 confirmed cases with respect to vaccination
     - Make at least 2 such KPI that presents the severity of case in different states (example: Any numerical measure to comment on how severe were the cases in Bihar as compared to that of Kerala).
     - Categorise total number of confirmed cases in a state by Months and come up with that one month which was worst for India in terms of number of cases.
     - Generate 2 - 3 insights that is very difficult to observe.

**Insights**
- The Average Response Rate and the Average Acceptance Rate is way higher for a Super_Host (above 95 and above 85 respectively) than a Non_Super_Host and also the Listing Prices is Lower for the Super_Host which will attract lot of customers. Also,The Average Review Score for a Super_Host (mostly above 4.8) in all Category is always higher than the Non_Super_Host. Also we can see that the response time for Super_Host is within an hour in most of the cases.
- The Average Response rate is Always above 95 for a Super_Host and below 95 for a Non_Super_Host in both the cities, and also the Average Acceptance Rate is above 85 for a Super_Host while below 85 for a Non_Super_Host. The Average Listing Price and The Average Availability Listing Price is also always Lower for a Super_Host in both the cities.
- The number of Positive words is higher for Super_Host while it is lower for Non_Super_Host and also there is low number of negative words for a Super_Host than Non_Super_Host.
- The number of Large Property_type is higher for a Non_Super_host than the Super_Host in both the States. So Super Hosts don’t tend to have large property types as compared to Other Hosts.
- The average price for both years i.e 2022 and 2023 is higher for a Non_Super_Host with max in 2022 and also the count of availability for both years is higher for Non_Super_Host with max in 2022 in both the cities.
- The average price for both years i.e 2022 and 2023 is higher for Non_Local_host with max in 2022 and also the count of availability for both years is higher for a Non_Local_host.
